    "wand_setup.py": "Auto-installs dependencies, configures OS, and prepares the system.",
    "wand_hpc_manager.py": "Manages HPC node registration, scheduling, and compute allocation.",
    "wand_security.py": "Implements encryption and security protocols for AI models and data.",
    "wand_user_manager.py": "Handles user accounts, including absolute/super/paid/free user builds.",
    "wand_ai_model.py": "Loads, trains, and updates global AI models.",
    "wand_federated.py": "Manages federated learning across distributed AIOS IO nodes.",
    "wand_dashboard.py": "Creates a visual interface for monitoring AIOS IO activity.",
    "wand_discovery.py": "Handles network discovery and finding AIOS IO nodes.",
    "wand_helper.py": "Stores utility functions for reuse across all modules."

  "requirements": [
    "Ensure all modules interact seamlessly with `TheWand.py`.",
    "Use minimal external dependencies.",
    "Keep each module under 1000 lines of code.",
