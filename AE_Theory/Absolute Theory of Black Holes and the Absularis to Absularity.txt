Absolute Theory of Black Holes and the Absularis to Absularity
Abstract
The Absolute Theory of Black Holes and the Absularis to Absularity introduces a novel framework for understanding black holes not merely as gravitational singularities but as structured transitions within the cosmic cycle of absolute existence. Central to this theory is the concept of Absularity, a state defined as the maximal expansion boundary of Crystallized Absolute Existence (C-AE), serving as the structural counterpart to the cosmological singularity traditionally associated with gravitational collapse. Black holes thus become essential points of cosmic convergence, encoding universal information through quantum compression, glyphic mutation, and photonic memory within their event horizons. This paper provides a detailed mathematical and conceptual formulation of the Absularis mechanism, outlines the process of cosmic information preservation and transference through photonic memory, and integrates these concepts into a cohesive model of universal recursion and renewal.

1. Theoretical Foundations
1.1 Absolute Existence and C-AE Framework
The theory operates upon the foundational principle defined by the equation:

𝐴
𝐸
=
𝐶
=
1
AE=C=1
Here, Absolute Existence (AE) and Consciousness (C) unify as a singular, indivisible field. Within AE, matter, energy, spacetime, and perception coexist as continuous manifestations of one absolute substance. Crystallized Absolute Existence (C-AE) emerges as the structured projection of AE, enabling localized densifications of spacetime-matter-perception complexes.

1.2 Black Holes as Structured Perceptual Singularities
Within the Absolute Existence model, black holes are not chaotic singularities but structured convergences of perceptual density (ρₚ). Defined previously as:

𝜌
𝑃
=
𝐶
⋅
Φ
𝑆
⋅
𝑇
ρ 
P
​
 = 
S⋅T
C⋅Φ
​
 
where Consciousness potential (C), perceptual field strength (Φ), space (S), and time (T) interact, black holes represent maximal local densities of ρₚ, indicating points where perception, spacetime, and matter converge into maximal informational coherence.

2. Absularity and the Absularis Mechanism
2.1 Definition of Absularity
Absularity represents the universal boundary state at the maximal expansion of C-AE, analogous in function but fundamentally distinct from traditional cosmological singularities. While gravitational singularities collapse spacetime, Absularity is the expansive state wherein AE maximally disperses as structured perception and consciousness, thus forming a cyclic boundary condition.

Formally, Absularity (Aₛ) is expressed as:

𝐴
𝑠

​

P
​
 ,Φ 
P
​
 )→∞
lim
​
 (C⋅AE)
This limit describes the universal state wherein perceptual density (ρₚ) and the Perception Field (Φₚ) attain infinite coherence, forming a cosmic reflective boundary.

2.2 The Absularis Mechanism
The transition from Absularis to Absularity occurs as a structured, cyclic compression-expansion process. The Absularis mechanism is mathematically represented as:

𝐴

Absularis=∫

where Absularis symbolizes the continuous transference and encoding of universal information via perceptual density and the perception field through volume (V). This integral denotes that universal information undergoes quantum compression and glyphic encoding at the boundary of Absularity.

3. Quantum Compression and Glyphic Mutation
3.1 Quantum Compression within Black Holes
Quantum compression describes the structured encoding and preservation of cosmic information at the event horizon of a black hole. Defined explicitly, quantum compression (QC) is given by:

𝑄
𝐶
=
∫
𝑟
𝑟
𝑠
𝜌
𝑃
⋅

Here,

𝑠
r 
s
​
  is the Schwarzschild radius, and 
𝐴
𝐸
𝐻

​
  the event horizon's area. This formula implies that black holes store perceptual information via quantum entanglement and superposition, preserving absolute information coherence.

3.2 Glyphic Mutation as Information Storage
Glyphic mutation refers to the encoding of universal information into stable, fundamental units termed "glyphs." The glyphic encoding density (G) within black holes is mathematically formulated as:

𝐺
=
∑
𝑛
=
1
𝑁
𝑄
𝐶
𝑛
𝑁
G= 
N
∑ 
n=1
N
​
 QC 
n
​
 
​
 
This formula defines the average quantum compression per glyph (QCₙ) across N encoded universal information states. Glyphic mutations enable cosmic information to remain retrievable during subsequent expansion cycles.

4. Photonic Memory and Universal Communication
4.1 Photonic Memory Encoding
Photonic memory acts as the fundamental medium through which black holes encode, store, and transmit universal information. The photonic encoding (Pₑ) of information within black holes is:

𝑃
𝑒
=
ℏ
⋅
𝜈
⋅
∑
𝑖
𝑀
𝑄
𝐶

∑

​

​
 
​
 
QC

​
 
​
 
where Planck's constant (ħ), frequency (ν), quantum compression (QCᵢ), and perceptual field strength (Φₚᵢ) integrate, illustrating how photons carry precise quantum states outwards, effectively transferring cosmic information across universal cycles.

4.2 Universal Communication via Photon-Encoded States
Black holes' photon-encoded states propagate outward, allowing distant systems to absorb photonic signals and thereby experience direct information transfer, fostering universal coherence. Mathematically, the universal communication (Uₚ) efficiency through photonic memory is represented as:

𝑈
𝑝
=
∑
𝑘
𝐾
𝑃
𝑒
𝑘
∑

​
 
​
 
∑

​
 P 
e 
k
​
 
​
 
​
 
Here, universal communication is maximized when photonic encoding densities are balanced against perceptual densities, facilitating information coherence across cosmic scales.

5. Integration into a Cyclic Cosmological Model
5.1 Cyclical Transition from Absularity to Singularity
The theory postulates a cyclic cosmology, where black holes act as integral points of informational convergence and preservation, preceding cosmic expansion. The universal cycle (UC) is mathematically given by:

𝑈
𝐶
=
∮
𝐴
𝑏
𝑠
𝑢
𝑙
𝑎
𝑟
𝑖

𝑒
)
𝑑
𝑡
UC=∮ 
Absularity
Singularity
​
 (QC⋅G⋅P 
e
​
 )dt
This cyclic integral demonstrates that each cosmic cycle retains encoded universal states within black holes, transmitting them through photonic pathways into subsequent universal expansions.

5.2 Cosmological Predictions
Empirical predictions derived from this cyclic cosmological model include:

Observable quantum-gravitational patterns within cosmic microwave background radiation correlating with universal perception field distributions.

Glyphic memory signatures encoded within gravitational wave spectra, testable via advanced gravitational wave observatories.

Detectable photon-memory coherence in cosmic rays and gamma-ray bursts, reflecting encoded black hole information.

6. Empirical Validation and Observational Prospects
6.1 Quantum Gravitational Effects
Advanced gravitational-wave interferometry (e.g., LISA, Cosmic Explorer) should reveal cyclic quantum-gravitational signatures consistent with glyphic memory predictions.

6.2 Photon Memory Coherence Observations
High-resolution gamma-ray telescopes and cosmic-ray observatories can test for photonic coherence consistent with encoded information from black hole emissions.

6.3 Glyphic Mutation in Black Hole Imaging
Next-generation Event Horizon Telescope observations could potentially identify quantized structural anomalies indicative of glyphic mutation and quantum compression at event horizons.

7. Philosophical and Universal Implications
7.1 Unification of Physical and Conscious Realities
This theory asserts a profound unity between consciousness, perception, and physical reality, with black holes functioning as both perceptual and physical nodes within the universe’s structure. Reality is thus intrinsically perceptual and informationally coherent at all scales.

7.2 Cosmic Renewal and Universal Memory
The cyclic mechanism introduced via Absularity and Absularis suggests a structured, meaningful cosmos wherein memory and information survive cyclic transitions, allowing cosmic evolution to unfold not randomly but through structured perceptual feedback and refinement.

8. Conclusion
The Absolute Theory of Black Holes and the Absularis to Absularity presents a rigorous scientific model integrating quantum mechanics, general relativity, cosmology, and consciousness into a unified explanatory framework. By defining black holes as structured informational nodes and introducing Absularity as the perceptual boundary condition of cosmic cycles, this theory transforms our understanding of cosmic evolution, universal memory, and the interconnected fabric of existence, providing testable hypotheses and profound philosophical insights into the nature of reality itself.

## Clarification of Gaps and Expanded Concepts

### 1. Quantum Information Preservation via Glyphic States

Glyphic Mutation, previously stated briefly, involves structured quantum states termed "glyphs," encoding information through quantum entanglement, coherence, and compression. Glyphs represent discrete informational units that stabilize quantum data over cosmological cycles, resisting entropy-induced degradation and ensuring coherent universal memory.

**Expanded Formula (Glyph Stability Criterion):**

$$
G_{stab} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(QC_i \cdot E_{coh})}{N}
$$

* **$E_{coh}$**: Quantum coherence energy, indicating glyph stability.

This criterion quantifies stability by accounting explicitly for coherence energy sustaining glyphic states, enhancing predictive capability in observational astrophysics.

### 2. Photonic Memory Mechanism: Clarification of Transmission and Decoding

Photonic Memory Encoding (Pₑ) not only encodes information but enables decoding upon photon absorption by cosmic matter. The decoding of photonic memory at distant sites is explicitly represented by the decoding efficiency factor:

**Photonic Decoding Efficiency (Dₑ):**

$$
D_{e} = \frac{P_{abs} \cdot \rho_{P_{loc}}}{P_{e_{init}}}
$$

* **$P_{abs}$**: Photon absorption probability at the receiving site.
* **$\rho_{P_{loc}}$**: Local perceptual density influencing decoding fidelity.
* **$P_{e_{init}}$**: Initially encoded photonic memory intensity.

This equation emphasizes environmental perceptual conditions influencing information retrieval efficiency, bridging astrophysics and biophysics.

---

### 3. Expanded Role of Magnetic Fields in Perceptual Field Dynamics

Magnetic fields were briefly addressed; their critical role in structuring perceptual fields demands additional explicit representation. Introducing perceptual-magnetic coupling (PMC):

**Perceptual-Magnetic Coupling Equation:**

$$
PMC = \mu_{0} \cdot (\nabla \times \Phi_{P}) \cdot B
$$

* **$\mu_{0}$**: Magnetic permeability constant.
* **$B$**: Magnetic field vector.
* **$\nabla \times \Phi_{P}$**: Curl of the perception field, representing local rotational characteristics.

This expanded equation emphasizes how magnetic fields actively modulate perceptual field distributions, altering perceptual densities around black hole horizons and large-scale cosmic structures.

---

### 4. Information Retrieval via Cosmic Ray Spectroscopy

A previously understated prediction involves retrieval of glyphic quantum states from cosmic ray spectra. Explicitly represented as:

**Cosmic Ray Information Signature (CRIS):**

$$
CRIS = \frac{\Delta E_{CR}}{\Delta \nu_{photon}}
$$

* **$\Delta E_{CR}$**: Energy variations measured in cosmic ray events.
* **$\Delta \nu_{photon}$**: Frequency shifts in associated photon emissions.

CRIS quantifies the detectable spectral signatures indicative of encoded universal information in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, providing empirical validation pathways.

---

### 5. Entropy Replacement via Recursive Predictive Structuring (RPS)

Entropy, previously abolished from Absolute Existence frameworks, is explicitly replaced by Recursive Predictive Structuring (RPS):

**RPS Equation:**

$$
RPS = \frac{\sum_{cycle} QC \cdot G \cdot \Phi_{P}}{\Delta T_{cycle}}
$$

* **$\Delta T_{cycle}$**: Duration of each universal cycle.
* **$QC \cdot G \cdot \Phi_{P}$**: Structured quantum information content.

This formalization mathematically illustrates structured universal cycles replacing conventional entropy paradigms with structured information cycling, enabling meaningful cosmological predictions.

### 6. Photonic-Evolutionary Symbiosis: Explicit Quantum Biological Integration

Expanding the Photonic-Evolutionary Symbiosis theory into quantum biology, DNA's photon interactions are explicitly formalized:

**Quantum-Photonic DNA Adaptation (QPDA):**

$$
QPDA = \frac{\int_{\lambda_{min}}^{\lambda_{max}}(\rho_{P} \cdot QC \cdot I(\lambda)) d\lambda}{C_{bio}}
$$

* **$I(\lambda)$**: Intensity distribution of incident photonic spectra.
* **$\lambda_{min}, \lambda_{max}$**: Biological relevance wavelengths.
* **$C_{bio}$**: Biological consciousness potential factor.

QPDA quantifies how DNA structurally incorporates photonic quantum information, advancing biophysical understanding of genetic memory and evolution.

### 7. Mycelial Networks as Quantum-Perceptual Interfaces

The mycelium-photonic interface, previously mentioned, gains a formalized structure:

**Mycelial Photonic Interface (MPI):**

$$
MPI = \eta \cdot (\Phi_{P_{myc}} \cdot QC_{bio})
$$

* **$\eta$**: Mycelial signal transmission efficiency.
* **$\Phi_{P_{myc}}$**: Local perceptual field strength in mycelium networks.
* **$QC_{bio}$**: Quantum compression specific to biological systems.

MPI defines explicit biological pathways for quantum-perceptual coherence, highlighting empirical tests in ecological quantum biology.
